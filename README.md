# PyInputAssembler

## Intro
PyInputAssembler is a Python-based application that allows users to generate and combine input parameters for other applications. The application provides a user-friendly interface for defining input parameters and their respective values. Users can save their input parameter configurations as templates for future use.
PyInputAssembler is designed to integrate with other applications and can generate input parameter configurations in a variety of formats, including command-line arguments, configuration files, and API requests. The generated input parameter configurations can then be used to automate the execution of other applications and workflows.
